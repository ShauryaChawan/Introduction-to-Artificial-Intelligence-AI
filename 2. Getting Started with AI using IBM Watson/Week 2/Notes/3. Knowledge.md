- NLU offers text analysis features.
- Ability to gather business intelligence, monitor social media, recommend content, and understand consumer sentiment.
- NLU analyzes keywords, concepts, and categories.
- Extraction of entities such as people, places, and organizations mentioned in text.
- Sentiment analysis to understand the positive or negative sentiment expressed.
- Ability to analyze distinct emotions behind text.

<hr/>

## Topic 4: Customization and Integration with Watson Developer Cloud
- Use IBM Watson Knowledge Studio to develop custom models for domain-specific entities and relations.
- Custom models can be integrated with Watson NLU.
- Publishing and using custom models through Watson Developer Cloud.
- Enhancing NLU with other services from the Watson Developer Cloud.
- Integration with Vision Services for analyzing images and videos.
- Integration with Speech Services for insights from transcribed audio data.

<hr/>

## Topic 5: Features and Capabilities of Watson NLU
- NLU implemented as a suite of APIs.
- Supports a variety of languages.
- Highly scalable and can handle large datasets.
- Data can be sent as plain text, HTML, or URLs.

# Watson Knowledge Studio

## Topic 1: Teaching Cognitive Systems Specialized Terminology
- It used to be impossible for anyone without a PhD in Machine Learning to teach a computer specialized terminology.
- Cognitive computing allows gaining insights from unstructured data, but for specialized areas, a cognitive system needs to be taught the unique language used.
- Examples of teaching include defining terms like virus, crash, or worm specific to the industry or domain and understanding the relationships between these entities.
- Traditional technologies relied on programming or creating rules to customize natural language systems.
- IBM Watson Knowledge Studio enables teaching Watson about specific interest areas faster through examples without writing code.
- Training time has been significantly reduced from years to weeks.
- Experts in any field can now train Watson without requiring PhDs in artificial intelligence.
- Pre-annotation of documents, specifying rules, and importing dictionaries can accelerate training and fine-tune results to meet requirements.

## Topic 2: Machine Learning Model Creation and Application

- Watson Knowledge Studio creates a machine-learning model based on the training.
- Watson can then learn on its own and identify entities and relationships that go beyond the training.
- The model can be used to build Content Analysis applications using Watson Discovery, Watson Natural Language Understanding, or Watson Explore.
- Watson Knowledge Studio helps build a machine learning annotator or extract information specific to business requirements.
- The collaborative workflow in Knowledge Studio allows multiple subject matter experts to work together, leading to better, more accurate, and quickly developed solutions.
- It is a single interface that supports the end-to-end development cycle of a machine-learning annotator.
- No data science expertise or programming is required.

## Topic 3: Applications and Benefits of Watson Knowledge Studio

- Examples of applications where Watson has been trained include identifying critical content to prevent cybersecurity attacks, understanding software support requests, and finding information about rare diseases.
- Watson Knowledge Studio has applications across financial, legal, technical, and environmental industries.
