# Watson Speech To Text

## Topic 1: Introduction to IBM Watson Speech to Text

- Speech To Text technology has been around for a long time, but current tools have limitations.
- IBM Watson is introducing a new Speech to Text tool that addresses these limitations.
- Most existing tools focus on transcribing short messages and search terms from high-quality audio.
- However, Watson Speech to Text aims to transcribe audio from various sources, such as phone calls, meetings, and broadcasts.
- It uses advanced statistical modeling techniques developed over decades of IBM Research and refined by cognitive computing ideas.
- The technology can transcribe both high-quality and lower-quality audio with accuracy.
- Watson Speech to Text automatically determines the most accurate results for words and phrases and presents them with confidence scores and metadata.

## Topic 2: Applications of IBM Watson Speech to Text

- Call centers can benefit from Watson Speech to Text by automatically transcribing millions of minutes of recorded audio.
- This transcription allows call centers to mine information from calls, identify issues, and provide better service to customers and agents.
- Accurate speech transcription can eliminate the need to take extensive notes during lectures and meetings.
- Users can actively pay attention to the discussion, and after the meeting, a transcription can be available from either audio or video recordings.
- The technology enables making the entire content of a library of recordings searchable without the need for human tagging.
- When combined with other services on the Watson Developer Cloud, more powerful cognitive applications can be built.

## Topic 3: Features of IBM Watson Speech to Text

- Watson Speech to Text is an API-based service specialized in converting human voice into text.
- The service provides translated text along with alternative translations and confidence scores for each translation.
- Out of the box, the service can translate general utterances and commonly used phrases.
- If needed, the service can be trained to recognize domain-specific terms, particularly useful for specific industries.
- IBM offers access to software development kits on GitHub for working with the Speech to Text service.
- Since the service is hosted on the IBM Cloud, it is scalable, allowing multiple services to work together to translate large amounts of speech into text.
- The service is highly customizable, and users can train it through the API to recognize specific words and phrases for their use case.
- Watson Speech to Text supports live streams and pre-recorded audio as input.

## Topic 4: Data Privacy and Ownership

- Importantly, all data passing through the Speech to Text service belongs to the user.
- Users have full ownership and control over their data, ensuring data privacy and security.

In summary, IBM Watson Speech to Text is an advanced technology that goes beyond traditional speech-to-text tools. It can transcribe audio from various sources, is highly accurate, and supports a wide range of applications, including call centers, lectures, and meetings. Users can customize the service for their specific needs and retain full ownership of their data.
