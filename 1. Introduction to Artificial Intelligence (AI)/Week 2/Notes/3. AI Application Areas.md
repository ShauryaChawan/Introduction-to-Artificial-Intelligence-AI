# Natural Lanuage Processing, Spech, Conputer Vision

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

- Subset of artificial intelligence.
- Enables computers to understand human language.
- Uses machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
- Analyzes grammar, relations, structure, and context.
- Determines semantic meaning and intent.
- Can infer emotions and nuances.

2. **Speech-to-Text:**

- Converts spoken language into text.
- Neural networks learn patterns from voice samples.
- Enables real-time transcription and closed captioning.
- Used in applications like call screening and video captioning.

3. **Text-to-Speech (Speech Synthesis):**

- Converts text into spoken language.
- Neural networks synthesize human-like voices.
- Enhances customer experience and personalization.
- Used in fields like medicine to restore natural voice for patients.

4. **Computer Vision:**

- Replicates human visual system in computers.
- Identifies and processes objects in images and videos.
- Advances in deep learning and neural networks.
- Used in self-driving cars, facial recognition, and augmented reality.
- Enables interaction between digital and physical worlds.
- Applications include image classification and object detection.

**NOTE:** These are some common application areas of artificial intelligence, each with its own subcategories and advancements. AI technology continues to evolve, enabling computers to perform complex tasks and interact with humans more effectively.

# Lesson Ssummary

In this lesson, you have learned:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand the meaning of human language, including the intent and context of use. 

- Speech-to-text enables machines to convert speech to text by identifying common patterns in the different pronunciations of a word, mapping new voice samples to corresponding words.

- Speech Synthesis enables machines to create natural sounding voice models, including the voice of particular individuals.

- Computer Vision enables machines to identify and differentiate objects in images the same way humans do.

- Self-driving cars is an application of AI that can utilize NLP, speech, and most importantly, computer vision.
