# AI Introduction 

## Cognitive Computing (Perception, Learing, Reasoing) 

AI is a leading technology in a new type of computing called Cognitive Computing. It's a completely different kind of computing compared to the ones we had before, which were based on programmable systems. It's as different as those systems were from the tabulating machines used a hundred years ago.

Traditional computing solutions, which originated in the 1940s and are based on mathematical principles, follow specific rules and logic to provide precise answers. They often use a rigid decision tree approach. However, with the abundance of big data available today and the need for more complex decision-making, this rigid approach often fails to keep up with the information at hand.

Cognitive Computing allows people to create new value by uncovering answers and insights hidden within large volumes of data. Whether it's a doctor diagnosing a patient, a wealth manager advising a client on retirement investments, or even a chef creating a new recipe, they all require new approaches to make sense of the vast amount of information they deal with every day.

Cognitive Computing systems imitate key cognitive aspects of human expertise. When humans try to understand something and make a decision, they go through four main steps. First, they observe visible phenomena and gather evidence. Then, they use their existing knowledge to interpret what they observe and generate hypotheses. Next, they evaluate those hypotheses to determine their accuracy. Finally, they make a decision by choosing the best option and acting accordingly.

Similarly, cognitive systems use similar processes to reason about the information they read, but they can do it much faster and on a larger scale. Unlike traditional computing solutions that can only handle structured data stored in databases, cognitive computing solutions can understand unstructured data, which constitutes about 80% of today's data. This unstructured data includes everything from literature, articles, and research reports to blogs, posts, and tweets.

While structured data is organized and well-defined, cognitive systems rely on natural language, which is governed by grammar, context, and culture. Natural language is implicit, ambiguous, complex, and challenging to process. Certain idioms, like the expression "feeling blue" when it's raining heavily, can be particularly difficult to understand. Cognitive systems read and interpret text like humans by analyzing the grammar, relationships, and structure of sentences to derive meaning from the written material. They also understand context, which goes beyond simple speech recognition.

Cognitive systems strive to grasp the true intent behind a user's language and use that understanding to draw inferences using linguistic models and algorithms. Furthermore, cognitive systems can learn, adapt, and become smarter over time. They learn from their interactions with us and from their own successes and failures, similar to how humans learn and improve.

Overall, Cognitive Computing represents a new frontier in computing that allows us to process vast amounts of unstructured data, understand natural language, and make more informed decisions.

## Lesson Summary 1 

In this lesson, you have learned:
Cognitive computing systems differ from conventional computing systems in that they can:

Read and interpret unstructured data, understanding not just the meaning of words but also the intent and context in which they are used.

Reason about problems in a way that humans reason and make decisions.

Learn over time from their interactions with humans and keep getting smarter.
