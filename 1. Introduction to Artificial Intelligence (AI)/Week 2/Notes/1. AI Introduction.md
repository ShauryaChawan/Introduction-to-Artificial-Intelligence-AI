# AI Introduction 

## Cognitive Computing (Perception, Learing, Reasoing) 

1. **Introduction**

    - AI is a leading technology in Cognitive Computing, a new type of computing.
    - Cognitive Computing is different from previous programmable systems.
    - Traditional computing solutions follow rules and logic, but struggle with big data and complex decision-making.
    - Cognitive Computing uncovers answers and insights from large volumes of data.

2. **Benefits of Cognitive Computing**

   - Provides new value by making sense of vast amounts of information.
   - Applicable in various domains, such as medicine, finance, and culinary arts.

3. **Cognitive Process in Human Expertise**

    - Four main steps in human decision-making process: observation, interpretation, evaluation, and decision.
    - Cognitive systems imitate these steps, but with greater speed and scalability.

4. **Handling Unstructured Data**

    - Traditional computing solutions handle structured data, while Cognitive Computing handles unstructured data.
    - Unstructured data comprises approximately 80% of today's data.
    - Examples of unstructured data: literature, articles, research reports, blogs, posts, and tweets.

5. **Understanding Natural Language**

    - Cognitive systems rely on natural language, which is implicit, ambiguous, complex, and challenging to process.
    - They analyze grammar, relationships, and sentence structure to derive meaning.
    - Context plays a crucial role in understanding natural language.

6. **Inference and Learning**

    - Cognitive systems aim to understand the true intent behind user language and draw inferences.
    - They use linguistic models and algorithms to adapt and become smarter over time.
    - Learning occurs through interactions and experiences, similar to human learning.

7. **Conclusion**

    - Cognitive Computing is a new frontier in computing, processing unstructured data and understanding natural language. 
    - It enables more informed decision-making.
