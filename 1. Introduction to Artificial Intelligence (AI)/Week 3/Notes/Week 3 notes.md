- AI should be able to explain its outcomes or recommendations
- Think of explainability as showing the AI's work

**B. Fairness**

- AI should treat individuals or groups equitably
- AI can counterbalance human biases, but bias in AI should be mitigated

**C. Robustness**

- AI should effectively handle exceptional conditions
- It should withstand intentional and unintentional interference

**D. Transparency**

- Appropriate information about the AI system's design and development should be shared with humans
- Information includes data used, data collection and storage methods, and access to data

**E. Privacy**

- AI should prioritize and safeguard humans' privacy and data rights
- Minimal data collection and consent-based repurposing of data

These 5 Pillars helps
- In designing, developing, deploying, and using AI ethically
- Align AI with human ethics and expectations.

# Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you have learned:

- Today's AI issues and concerns include how to build and use AI responsibly and how AI is used in healthcare, facial recognition, social media and marketing, and hiring

- AI ethics is a multidisciplinary field that investigates how to optimize AI's beneficial impact while reducing risks and adverse impacts

- AI ethics is a "socio-technical" challenge, meaning that it cannot be solved by tools alone

- AI ethics principles are:
    - The purpose of AI is to augment — not replace — human intelligence
    - Data and insights belong to their creator
    - New technology must be transparent and explainable

- Explainability: The ability of an AI system to provide insights that humans can use to understand the causes of the system's predictions.
    - Fairness: The equitable treatment of individuals or groups of individuals.
    - Robustness: The ability of an AI system to effectively handle exceptional conditions, such as abnormal input or adversarial attacks.
    - Transparency: Sharing appropriate information with stakeholders on how an AI system has been designed and developed.
    - Privacy: AI systems must prioritize and safeguard consumers’ privacy and data rights.

- In AI, bias gives systematic disadvantages to certain groups or individuals

- One potential cause of bias in AI is the implicit or explicit biases of the people who design and develop AI

- One way to mitigate bias is to assemble diverse teams

- Regulations are government rules enforceable by law.

- AI governance is an organization's act of governing, through its corporate instructions, staff, processes and systems
